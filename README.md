# Memory Game

## Introduction

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have 
successfully been matched. 

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if
they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to 
win the game, and what the star rating was.
